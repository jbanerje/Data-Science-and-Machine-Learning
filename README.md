# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

### About Me
I create amazing stories and insights with data and transform complex data into highly-customized, actionable, and scalable solutions  and help clients make better data-driven decisions leading to bringing new business, understanding target market and customer segmentation, boosting customer loyalty and making client PCI compliant.

I have experience in exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and statistics. I am passionate about learning new topics in data science, visualizing data and doing research. I love sharing valuable insights and making an impact that helps others learn through code, visualizations, and narratives.

    - [Honey_Production_Analysis
    In The USA (1998-2012)](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Vizualization/Honey%20Production.ipynb): Question that were answered  - How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2012? Over time, which states produce the most honey? Which produce the least? Which have experienced the most change in honey yield? Does the data show any trends in terms of the number of honey producing colonies and yield per colony before 2006, which was when concern over Colony Collapse Disorder spread nationwide? Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and value of production every year? How has value of production, which in some sense could be tied to demand, changed every year?
