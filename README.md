    In The USA (1998-2012)](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Vizualization/Honey%20Production.ipynb): Question that were answered  - How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2012? Over time, which states produce the most honey? Which produce the least? Which have experienced the most change in honey yield? Does the data show any trends in terms of the number of honey producing colonies and yield per colony before 2006, which was when concern over Colony Collapse Disorder spread nationwide? Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and value of production every year? How has value of production, which in some sense could be tied to demand, changed every year?
