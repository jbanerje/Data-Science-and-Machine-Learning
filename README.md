# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

### About Me
I create amazing stories and insights with data and transform complex data into highly-customized, actionable, and scalable solutions  and help clients make better data-driven decisions leading to bringing new business, understanding target market and customer segmentation, boosting customer loyalty and making client PCI compliant.

I have experience in exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and statistics. I am passionate about learning new topics in data science, visualizing data and doing research. I love sharing valuable insights and making an impact that helps others learn through code, visualizations, and narratives.

### About the repository
This is Jagannath Banerjee's repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed for academic, self learning, and professional purposes. Portfolio is presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

### Tools
  - **Python** : NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
  - **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn

- ## Data Analysis and Visualization (Using Python - Matplotlib & Seaborn)
    - [Honey_Production_Analysis
    In The USA (1998-2012)](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Vizualization/Honey%20Production.ipynb): Question that were answered  - How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2012? Over time, which states produce the most honey? Which produce the least? Which have experienced the most change in honey yield? Does the data show any trends in terms of the number of honey producing colonies and yield per colony before 2006, which was when concern over Colony Collapse Disorder spread nationwide? Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and value of production every year? How has value of production, which in some sense could be tied to demand, changed every year?

    - [K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification ](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Machine%20Learning%20Basic%20Model/KNN_Classification.ipynb): K-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification where the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space.
    - [Naïve Bayes](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Machine%20Learning%20Basic%20Model/Naive_Bayes.ipynb): Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.
    - [Support Vector Machine (SVM)]
    - [Decision Tree Classification](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Machine%20Learning%20Basic%20Model/Decision_Tree.ipynb): Decision Tree classiffier is a type of Supervised Machine Learning algorithm which organizes a series of test questions and conditions in a tree structure and the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.
    - [Random Forest Classification](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Machine%20Learning%20Basic%20Model/Random_Forest.ipynb):Random forest classifcation is an ensemble learning method for classification that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. Random forests correct for decision trees habit of overfitting to their training set
