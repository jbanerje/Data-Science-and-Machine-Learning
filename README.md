### About Me
I create amazing stories and insights with data and transform complex data into highly-customized, actionable, and scalable solutions  and help clients make better data-driven decisions leading to bringing new business, understanding target market and customer segmentation, boosting customer loyalty and making client PCI compliant.

I have experience in exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and statistics. I am passionate about learning new topics in data science, visualizing data and doing research. I love sharing valuable insights and making an impact that helps others learn through code, visualizations, and narratives.

### About the repository
This is Jagannath Banerjee's repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed for academic, self learning, and professional purposes. Portfolio is presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

### Tools
  - **Python** : Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
  - **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn

## Contents
- ## Machine Learning
    - [Telco Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Machine_Learning/Telco%20Customer%20Churn.ipynb): Classification - Analyzing Telco customer data to understand reason for churn and who could be the next potential customer to leave the company and What contributes to the higher churn rate of customer and what could be some of the probable solution to address the same.

    - [Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Machine_Learning/UCI%20Wine%20Quality%20Assessment.ipynb): Regression  - Predicting the quality of wine using 12 physiochemical properties. Detailed exploratory data analysis to confirm if there is any relationship between the chemical composition and the quality of white wine.
    - [IrisÂ Classification](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Machine_Learning/Iris_Classification.ipynb): Classification - Predicting the Iris species - Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Verginica using Iris sepal length , sepal width , petal length and petal width.

- ## Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
    - [Honey_Production_Analysis
    In The USA (1998-2012)](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Vizualization/Honey%20Production.ipynb): Question that were answered  - How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2012? Over time, which states produce the most honey? Which produce the least? Which have experienced the most change in honey yield? Does the data show any trends in terms of the number of honey producing colonies and yield per colony before 2006, which was when concern over Colony Collapse Disorder spread nationwide? Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and value of production every year? How has value of production, which in some sense could be tied to demand, changed every year?

- ## My Blogs
    - [Handling Missing & Incorrect Data](https://github.com/jbanerje/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/IPythonNotebook_Machine%20Learning%20Basic%20Model/Handling%20Missing%20%26%20Incorrect%20Data.ipynb):Before handling a machine learning problem, it becomes utmost important to clean, standardize and prepare the data so that it can be used effectively for the building efficient machine learning models. Preparing the data takes majority of time for a data scientist and data engineers (anywhere around 50% to 70% of total time).In this tutorial we will learn about how to identify the missing data or incorrect data and how to replace the same. We will be using Python code to illustrate and solve
